          <div class="text-sm-h4 my-5 ml-3 brown--text font-weight-bold">This is Hosoda and Tahara Laboratory. Thank you for your visiting this site.</div>
          <p class="text-sm-h5 mt-3 ml-5">
            We welcome all the foreign students who pursue the nature of materials, materials technology and physical metallurgy, especially to pursue not only master degree but also Dr. degree (Ph.D.) from the scientific and engineering viewpoints. Our research topics are materials design, innovation and development for new structural and multi-functional materials and composites used for energy and medical applications. The research field of this laboratory is primary physical metallurgy, and drastic material development and improvement for the innovation of practical applications are also our targets. Not only experimental approaches but also theoretical and calculation approaches such as FEM are focused. Since this laboratory belongs not only to Department of Materials Science and Engineering but also Institute of Innovative Research (IIR), we have been strongly conducting the advanced/frontier researches. Then, students who strongly like research, science and technology are much welcome. IIR is the only one research organization of Tokyo Tech which contains 4 research laboratories, and Novel Prize Prof. Ohsumi also belongs to IIR. Our laboratory (Hosoda and Tahara Lab) belongs to two of 4 research laboratories: Laboratory for Materials and Structures (MSL) and Laboratory for Future Interdisciplinary Research of Science and Technology (FIRST). Then, this laboratory is a good choice for the students who want to do research.
